# ðŸ§  Inventory Optimization AI

A reinforcement learning-based simulation environment and agent for intelligent
inventory control in supply chain systems. This project combines deep learning,
operations research, and cloud-friendly tools to demonstrate a scalable,
data-driven approach to supply chain optimization.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Inventory management is a fundamental challenge in supply chain operations.
This project simulates a retail inventory system where an agent learns to
minimize costs associated with holding, ordering, and stockouts using
reinforcement learning techniques such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and PPO.

Key Features:
- Custom OpenAI Gym environment for inventory simulation
- Reinforcement learning agents trained using `stable-baselines3`
- Exploratory data analysis and demand modeling
- Modular, Dockerized codebase suitable for cloud deployment
